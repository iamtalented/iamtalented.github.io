##Who are we?

We are a group of individuals who believe that everyone is talented, no matter what grades they get in school, or their social status. I Am Talented is an initiative to help them discover the talent within them.

##What do we do?

We run an annual event to teach skills to kids from the schools in Singapore, and empower them to step beyond the school, and learn a skill that is not taught in school.
